            <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
            <p><strong>Tart Crust</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt in the bowl 
                    of a food processor and pulse to combine.</li>
                <li>Scatter the pieces of butter over the flour mixture. Pulse 
                    until the mixture resembles coarse yellow meal without any white 
                    powdery bits remaining, about 20 pulses. Transfer the mixture to 
                    a large mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Beat the egg yolks with the cream and vanilla and pour them into 
                    the flour-butter mixture. Toss with a spatula until the dough 
                    clumps together. If the dough is dry, add 1 more tablespoon 
                    heavy cream (better too wet than too dry).</li>
                <li>Divide the dough in half, form into disks, wrap in plastic wrap, 
                    and chill at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Filling</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Just before you are ready to roll out the dough, warm the golden 
                    syrup in a saucepan until it is runny, or microwave it for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Combine the golden syrup, bread crumbs, lemon zest, and lemon juice 
                    in a mixing bowl and mix well.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Putting it Together</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400<sup>o</sup>F. Remove the dough from the 
                    refrigerator. On a floured surface, roll out the larger disk into 
                    an 11-inch circle. Fold it into quarters, brush off the excess flour 
                    with a pastry brush after each fold, then unfold it into a 9-in tart 
                    pan, easing the sides gently into the pan and pressing the dough into 
                    the fluted edges. Trim the dough even with the rim.</li>
                <li>Roll out the second disk 1/8-inch thick. Cut the dough in long strips 
                    for the lattice topping.</li>
                <li>Scrape the filling into the prepared crust and smooth the top with a 
                    rubber spatula. Lay half the strips of dough over the filling in one 
                    direction and the other half in the opposite direction to form a 
                    lattice. Trim the overhang. Gently brush the beaten egg over the 
                    lattice.</li>
                <li>Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 375<sup>o</sup>F 
                    and bake another 25 minutes until the crust is browned and the 
                    filling puffs up in the center. Serve warm with custard or whipped 
                    cream.</li>
