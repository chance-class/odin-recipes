            <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
            <p><b>Pie Crust</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the flour, salt, and cold butter in a mixing bowl fitted 
                    with a paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until the butter 
                    gets worked down to hazelnut-sized pieces.</li>
                <li>Add the cold water a bit at a time until the down comes 
                    together when pressed. Wrap and refrigerate for one hour.</li>
                <li>Preheat the over to 350<sup>o</sup> F. After an hour, lightly 
                    flour your work surface and roll the dough out in a large 9-10" 
                    circle. Place it onto your pie pan and crimp the edges.</li>
                <li>Place a piece of parchment paper on top and weigh it down with 
                    baking beans. Bake for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the baking beans and parchment paper and bake for 
                    another 10 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Pie Filling</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the milk and coconut milk in a saucepan. In another 
                    bown, mix together the yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla 
                    extract. Add a splash of milk from your saucepan to allow for 
                    easier mixing.</li>
                <li>Place the saucepan over medium heat until it starts to simmer. 
                    Temper the yolk mizture with the hot milk. Return the milk back 
                    to the saucepan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Whisk continually until it starts to really thicken and bubble. 
                    Remove from the heat and mix in the unsalted butter until 
                    melted and combined.</li>
                <li>Pour the mixture into the baked pie shell. Cover with plastic 
                    wrap and refrigerate overnight or for 4 hours until set.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Whip Topping</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk your cold heavy cream in a stand mixer fitted with a 
                    whisk attachment over medium speed. Once bubbles start to foam 
                    on top, add your sugar. Whisk until you get medium stiff 
                    peaks.</li>
                <li>Take half of the mixture and place it into a bowl. Take 2/3 of 
                    the second half of the whip and place it into another bowl.</li>
                <li>Take the larger amount of whip and whisk in one drop of orange 
                    food gel coloring and 4-5 drops red food gel coloring. Whisk until 
                    well combined. The white should now hold very stiff peaks.</li>
                <li>In the medium bowl of whip, whisk in 2-3 drops of blue food gel 
                    coloring. Whisk until well combined. In the last bowl, mix 2 drops 
                    of food gel coloring. Whisk until well combined.</li>
                <li>Evenly spread the red cream onto the pie. Place the blue whip into 
                    a piping bag fit with a large round tip. Pipe 6 dollops around the 
                    pie and finally, with spoon a bit of the green filling in the 
                    center.</li>
