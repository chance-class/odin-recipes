            <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat over to 350<sup>o</sup>F. 
                Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or 
                buttering and lightly flouring.</li>
                <li>Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt 
                    and espresso powder to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand 
                    mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle 
                    attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.</li>
                <li>Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture 
                    and mix together on medium speed until well combined. Reduce 
                    speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter 
                    until well combined.</li>
                <li>Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake 
                    pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake 
                    tester inserted in the center of the chocolate cake comes 
                    out clean.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, 
                    remove from the pan and cool completely.</li>
                <li>Frost cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>The cake batter will be very thin after adding the boiling water. 
            This is correct and results in the most delicious and moist chocolate 
            cake!</p>
